                This is the personal website of Ethan Rahn.
                
                I am a software engineer, specializing in cybersecurity.

                > - I am most familiar with securing products (this may be referred to as "blue team" stuff) üõ°Ô∏è
                > - I have an, unfortunate, familiarity with certification standards such as "FIPS 140" and "cPPND" (fka "Common Criteria") üìùÔ∏è
                I enjoy reading about technology and imagining where it will take the world next.
